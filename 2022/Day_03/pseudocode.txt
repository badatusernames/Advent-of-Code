My start interpretation of the subtasks from reading the challenge

Part 1:

Load input file

Read rows
    for each row
        Split string in half
            save in variable
        for each variable1
            search variable2 for match
            save in matchesFound

For each place in matchesFound
    determine priority
        add priority to totalScore

Print totalScore

Part 2:

Load input file

Read file to array
    Split on newline

Break up the file into sets of three

For each backpack in the set
    Convert string to individual characters in an array
    Convert array of characters in set (dedup)
    Find intersection() of the set of three to get the common value in all the backpacks

Convert the common value into the priority
    Add the priorty to the total priority

Print total priority
